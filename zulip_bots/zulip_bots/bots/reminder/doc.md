# Reminder Bot

## Setup

No setup is required to use Reminder Bot.

To access the help menu, send the command `help`.

## Usage

Reminder Bot can remind you of whatever you want. It has 2 modes: advanced and
normal.

### Normal

In **normal**, mode you can just send a message to Reminder Bot and have it
remind you in 5 minutes.

 > @**Reminder Bot** Walk the dog.

…and then 5 minutes later in a private message from Reminder Bot…

 > Walk the dog.

### Advanced

In **advanced** mode you can control when to get the reminder and whether it
should be public or private. You have to put your reminder in quotes.

For example,

 > @**Reminder Bot** "Water the plants." in 20 minutes

or

 > @**Reminder Bot** "Water the plants." in 20 mins

or even

 > @**Reminder Bot** "Water the plants." in 20 seconds

…and then in a private message…

 > Water the plants.

You can also do

  > @**Reminder Bot** "Take out the trash." public

…and then, in the current stream for all subscribers to see…

 > Take out the trash.

Or, you can do both at once

 > @**Reminder Bot** "Make the bed." in 20 minutes public

…and then, in the current stream 30 minutes later…

 > Make the bed.
